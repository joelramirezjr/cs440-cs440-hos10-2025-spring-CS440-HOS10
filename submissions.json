    "title": "OceanGate Titan Submarine Incident (June 2023)",
    "description": "A crewed submersible vessel designed by OceanGate to carry researchers and tourists to the Titanic wreck (~3,800\u202fm depth). The onboard software controls navigation, life\u2011support, pressure monitoring, and emergency systems.",
    "objectives": "Safety and Fault Tolerance \u2014 software must detect anomalies in hull pressure, structural integrity, life\u2011support, and safely handle failures.\r\n\r\nReliability under high pressure \u2014 system must maintain operation and accuracy under extreme depth and pressure.\r\n\r\nReal\u2011time Monitoring and Alerting \u2014 immediate detection of out\u2011of\u2011range sensor data and automated emergency responses.",
    "roles": "Developer",
    "standards": "Other",
    "test_plan": "Unit tests on sensor-read modules: verify zero, out-of-range, and corrupted inputs.\r\n\r\nIntegration tests: entire life\u2011support and navigation software on hardware-in-the-loop or high\u2011fidelity simulators.\r\n\r\nFault\u2011injection tests: simulate communications dropouts, erroneous sensor outputs, power loss, memory corruption.\r\n\r\nStress/duration tests: simulate continuous 48+ hour deep-sea mission.\r\n\r\nEmergency procedure tests: verify automated response on pressure spike, critical oxygen drop, or structural compromise.",
    "defect_management": "All identified defects logged in a centralized tracking system (e.g., JIRA) with severity classifications.\r\n\r\nHigh-severity issues (safety-critical) must have patches or mitigations before any launch.\r\n\r\nRoot-cause analysis required for any failure in test; findings must be approved by Software Safety Engineer.",
    "reviews": "Peer code reviews are mandatory for all safety-critical modules.\r\n\r\nSafety audits per IEC\u202f61508 by an independent safety assessor before deployment.\r\n\r\nDesign reviews with cross-functional teams (software, mechanical, systems, QA) at completion of major risk zones (e.g., 10k LOC, new feature modules).",
    "supplier_control": "External sensor/hardware suppliers must provide documentation, interface specifications, and evidence of testing at full-depth conditions.\r\n\r\nSoftware libraries and third-party components must have signed SBOMs and documented licenses.\r\n\r\nAll supplier deliverables undergo integration tests before acceptance.",

    "purpose": "To ensure the Titan submersible\u2019s software is reliable, safe under extreme conditions, and capable of detecting or mitigating failures, preventing a catastrophic incident like hull breach or life\u2011support failure."
